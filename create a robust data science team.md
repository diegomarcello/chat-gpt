Creating a robust process for data science involves several key steps. Here are some of the important steps:

1- Defining the problem: First, you need to clearly define the problem you are trying to solve, the questions you want to answer, and the outcomes you want to achieve.

2- Collecting and preparing data: Next, you need to collect and prepare the data for analysis. This includes cleaning, transforming, and pre-processing the data so that it is suitable for analysis.

3- Exploratory data analysis: Once the data is ready, you should perform exploratory data analysis to understand the data and identify patterns, relationships, and potential problems.

4- Feature engineering: Feature engineering involves selecting and transforming the features that are most relevant to the problem you are trying to solve.

5- Selecting and training models: This step involves selecting the appropriate models and training them on the data. You should also evaluate the performance of the models and select the best one.

6- Model evaluation and tuning: Once you have trained the models, you need to evaluate their performance and tune the hyperparameters to optimize their performance.

7- Deployment and monitoring: Finally, you should deploy the model in a production environment and monitor its performance to ensure that it continues to deliver accurate and relevant results.

It is important to note that each of these steps requires careful planning, execution, and continuous improvement to create a robust process for data science.
