To create a BigQuery ML model of soccer prediction, you need to follow the steps below:

First, create a BigQuery dataset and a table to store your data. You can use the following command to create a dataset:
php
Copy code
bq mk <dataset-name>
Next, upload your data to the table you just created. You can use the following command to upload a CSV file:
css
Copy code
bq load --autodetect --source_format=CSV <dataset-name>.<table-name> <path-to-csv-file>
Once your data is loaded, you can create a BigQuery ML model using SQL. Here's an example:
sql
Copy code
CREATE MODEL <model-name>
OPTIONS(model_type='logistic_reg') AS
SELECT
  IF(home_goals > away_goals, 1, 0) AS label,
  home_team,
  away_team,
  home_shots,
  away_shots,
  home_corners,
  away_corners
FROM
  <dataset-name>.<table-name>;
This creates a logistic regression model to predict the outcome of a soccer game based on the number of shots and corners for each team.

Once the model is created, you can evaluate its performance using the EVALUATE function. Here's an example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL <model-name>, (
  SELECT
    IF(home_goals > away_goals, 1, 0) AS label,
    home_team,
    away_team,
    home_shots,
    away_shots,
    home_corners,
    away_corners
  FROM
    <dataset-name>.<table-name>));
This will return metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Finally, you can use the PREDICT function to make predictions on new data. Here's an example:
sql
Copy code
SELECT
  home_team,
  away_team,
  home_shots,
  away_shots,
  home_corners,
  away_corners,
  predicted_label
FROM
  ML.PREDICT(MODEL <model-name>, (
    SELECT
      home_team,
      away_team,
      home_shots,
      away_shots,
      home_corners,
      away_corners
    FROM
      <dataset-name>.<new-data-table>));
This will return the predicted outcome of each game in the new data.
