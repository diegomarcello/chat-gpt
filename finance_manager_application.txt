To create a Python application to manage finance, you can use various libraries and frameworks that can help you with tasks such as retrieving financial data, tracking expenses, and generating reports. Here's an example architecture for a simple finance management application:

Database: Use a database to store financial data, such as income, expenses, and investments. You can use a SQL database such as SQLite or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database such as MongoDB or Firebase.

Web Framework: Use a web framework such as Flask or Django to create a user interface for the application. The web interface can allow users to view their financial data, add or edit expenses and income, and generate reports.

Data Retrieval: Use an API or a library to retrieve financial data, such as stock prices or exchange rates. You can use APIs such as Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance, or libraries such as Pandas DataReader or BeautifulSoup.

Expense Tracking: Use a library or a tool to track expenses and income, and store them in the database. You can use libraries such as PyMoney or Expenses, or tools such as Mint or Personal Capital.

Reporting: Use a library or a tool to generate financial reports, such as balance sheets, income statements, or cash flow statements. You can use libraries such as PyFPDF or ReportLab, or tools such as QuickBooks or Xero.

Here's an example code for a Flask-based finance management application that uses a SQLite database to store financial data:
